Currently, my research falls into 4 broad themes:

### Using statistical models to make evolutionary inferences from phylogenetic trees

### Understanding how microevolutionary processes scale up to generate macroevolutionary patterns

### Macroevolution and macroecology of Angiosperm functional traits

### Evolution of sex chromosomes
