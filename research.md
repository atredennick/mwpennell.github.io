Currently, my research falls into 4 broad themes

### Using statistical models to make evolutionary inferences from phylogenetic trees 

### Understanding how microevolutionary processes scale up to generate macroevolutionary patterns

After a century or so of work, evolutionary biologists now have a fairly good understanding of the forces that drive evolutionary change within populations. Predicting the dynamics of populations, species and groups of species, has proven to be much more challenging. Contrary to the popular misconception, if we extrapolated the rates of evolutionary change we observe at the population level over deep time, we would expect species to be much *more* different than they actually are. My favored approach for resolving this so called "paradox of stasis" is to interpret models of macroevolutionary change that are connected 

### Macroevolution and macroecology of Angiosperm functional traits

### Evolution of sex chromosomes
