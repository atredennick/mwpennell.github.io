As a part of my research, I develop statistical software for analyzing biological data.

### [arbutus](https://github.com/mwpennell/arbutus) 

Assess the adequacy of phylogenetic models of trait evolution. Developed in collaboration with [Rich FitzJohn](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~fitzjohn/), [Will Cornwell](http://phylodiversity.net/wcornwell/) and [Luke Harmon](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~lukeh/).

### [geiger](https://github.com/mwpennell/geiger-v2)

A broad suite of tools for analyzing phylogenetic comparative data. This is a large collaborative project including contributions by Jon Eastman, [Graham Slater](http://http://fourdimensionalbiology.com/), [Joseph Brown](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~josephwb/), [Josef Uyeda](http://people.oregonstate.edu/~uyedaj/), [Rich FitzJohn](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~fitzjohn/), [Mike Alfaro](http://pandorasboxfish.squarespace.com/) and [Luke Harmon]((http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~lukeh/).

### [capwire](https://github.com/mwpennell/capwire)

Software for estimating population census size from non-invasive genetic sampling. Developed with help from [Craig Miller](http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology/faculty/craigmiller). Paper is [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.12019/abstract) [(PDF)](http://mwpennell.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mer_capwire.pdf).
